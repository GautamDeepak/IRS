### Objective

This week we will start looking into the active remote sensing. Todays prac is not computer based. We have a hands on demonstration of terresterial laser scanning. We will go out in the campus to scan boab trees using one of our laser scanner (Leica BLK360). 

---------------------------------------------------
## 1. About the Leica BLK360.
Leica BLK360 was originally designed for use in arcitecture and surveying. The unit is quite compact that its useful in environmental remote sensing to carry around and scan the area of interest. The Leica BLK360 captures full-colour panoramic images overlaid on a high-accuracy point cloud. It is very compact in size and simple to use with the single push of one button. 

Have a read about the Leica BLK360 [here](https://leica-geosystems.com/products/laser-scanners/scanners/blk360)

Have a look at the introduction to the BLK360

## 2. Demonstration
1. Now its our turn to scan - lets go to Boab court. 
 
2. We will scan around Boab court and you will use this data to learn the CloudCompare in next week prac.
