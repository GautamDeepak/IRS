### Objective

In the last prac, we started working with Landsat images and looked into spectral reflectance of various landcover types. Today, we will continue our journey of working with Landsat-8 images and look into indices to analyse the condition of our landscape. We will specifically look into NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalised difference water index). worked with Sentinel-2 imagery. The earlier provides insight into the vegetation cover, vigour, and health, the latter provides insight into the dryness of our landscape including vegetation.
